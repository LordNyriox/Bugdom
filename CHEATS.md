# Bugdom 1.3.0 Cheats

## In main menu

Hold down F10 and click on the START icon to bring up a level select dialog.

NOTE: This dialog doesn't work on Linux yet. 

## In game

For most of these you need to hold down the tilde/backtick key while pressing an F-number key.
Tilde is the key above Tab on a US keyboard layout.

- \` + F1 = win this level
- \` + F2 = show player coordinates
- \` + F3 = full health
- \` + F4 = full ball timer
- \` + F5 = full inventory
- \` + F6 = toggle liquid invincibility
- \` + F9 = display debug
- F11 (without tilde) = toggle fullscreen/windowed mode

## During Pangea splash screen

**While the Pangea logo is shown after the game starts up**, you can trigger the following debug features:

- Hold down F2 and press Space to show the Save and Load screens.

- Hold down F3 and press Space to show the Lose and Win screens.

- Hold down F4 and press Space to show the Settings screen.

- Hold down a number key (1 2 3 ...8 9 0) and press Space to jump to the corresponding level

- Hold down F1 and press Space to bring up a model viewer.
  If you run this in windowed mode, information about the current model will be shown in the title bar. It's a bit clunky, but here are the controls:

  - [Tab] next model ([Shift-tab] previous model)
  - [Enter] next animation or object ([Shift-enter] previous anim or object),
  - [Space] toggle between skeletons and "display group" objects
  - [</>] swivel cam,
  - [z/shift-z] zoom in/out,
  - [g] toggle additive blending
