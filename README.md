This is a fork of Pangea Software’s *Bugdom*, updated to run on modern operating systems.

Forked from [**@jorio**](https://github.com/jorio)’s version, at [jorio/Bugdom](https://github.com/jorio/Bugdom), which is [approved by Pangea Software](https://pangeasoft.net/bug/register.html).

## About This Fork

[*Bugdom*](https://pangeasoft.net/bug/index.html) is a 1999 Macintosh game by Pangea Software. You play as Rollie McFly, a pill bug on a quest to save ladybugs from King Thorax’s iron grip on the Bugdom.

The game was bundled with some Mac models of the era. It is probably the most advanced game that uses QuickDraw 3D. Unfortunately, QuickDraw 3D has not been updated past Mac OS 9, so experiencing the game used to require booting a PowerPC Mac into OS 9 — until [**@jorio**](https://github.com/jorio)’s port came out.

After [**@jorio**](https://github.com/jorio) finished porting [Nanosaur](https://github.com/jorio/Nanosaur), Pangea offered to let him port Bugdom. [**@jorio**](https://github.com/jorio) and [I](https://github.com/LordNyriox) were both excited to update this gem of a game because it was a childhood favorite of ours.

This fork aims to provide the best way to experience *Bugdom* today. It introduces some modern comforts, fixes some gameplay bugs, and [extends the maximum render distance](https://github.com/jorio/Bugdom/issues/24) to *6 times* that of the original game.
